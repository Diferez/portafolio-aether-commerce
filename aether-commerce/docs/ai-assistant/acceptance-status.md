# AI Assistant Acceptance Status

Last updated: 2026-07-21

This document tracks current evidence for the Aether AI sales assistant implementation. It is intentionally conservative: an item is not considered complete unless there is direct evidence in code, tests, documentation, or runtime behavior.

- `pnpm exec playwright test tests/e2e/assistant-widget.spec.ts --project=desktop --reporter=line`: passed, 9 tests plus 1 mobile-only skipped test, including structured product rendering, current product/category context, add-to-cart feedback from assistant product cards, keyboard close/focus return, safe handling of malformed stream events, malformed cart-summary rejection, streaming product/cart rendering, product availability display, variant display, and disabled cart mutation for unavailable products.
- `pnpm exec playwright test tests/e2e/assistant-widget.spec.ts --project=mobile --reporter=line`: passed, 10 tests, including the full-screen mobile assistant dialog, input focus, keyboard close/focus return, safe handling of malformed stream events, malformed cart-summary rejection, streaming product/cart rendering, product availability display, variant display, and disabled cart mutation for unavailable products.
- `tests/test_acceptance_docs.py`: passed through `python tests/run_direct.py`, covering required AI assistant docs, Mermaid diagrams, README operations, CI gate documentation, and required environment variable coverage in `.env.example` and `Settings`.
- `tests/test_acceptance_docs.py` also covers that the production workflow builds and smoke-tests the AI assistant image before deployment steps.
- `tests/test_acceptance_docs.py` also covers that the production smoke-test container has a shell cleanup trap, so a failing smoke test does not leave the container running in CI.
- `tests/test_acceptance_docs.py` also covers that the production workflow validates required Cloudflare secrets before expensive build/deploy work.
- `tests/test_acceptance_docs.py` also covers that `npm run deploy:preflight` exists and checks required GitHub Actions deployment variables/secrets by name without exposing secret values.
- `tests/test_api_contract_docs.py`: passed through `python tests/run_direct.py`, covering assistant endpoints, structured response contracts, SSE events, security headers, product-card fields, and the documented `ProductVariant` schema.
- `tests/test_api_smoke.py`: passed through `python tests/run_direct.py`, covering health, readiness, metrics, streaming events, rate limits, internal operations endpoints and production readiness checks.
- `scripts/acceptance_audit.py`: added to report required AI assistant artifacts, evaluation dataset size, and known production blockers in a machine-readable JSON shape.
- `docs/ai-assistant/requirements-audit.md`: maps the original requirements to direct workspace evidence and production blockers.
- `docker version`: passed with Docker Desktop 4.77.0 and Linux engine visible from this workspace.
- `docker build -t aether-ai-assistant:test .`: passed.
- `python scripts/smoke.py`: passed against the temporary Docker container on port 8090.
- Docker image build and container smoke test are now verified locally from this workspace. CI and production workflows also include Docker checks and clean up the test container on failure.
- `PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX=F:\Freelance\Portafolio\tmp\pycache-check python -m compileall app tests scripts`: passed, avoiding stale locked Windows `__pycache__` files.
- GitHub `production` environment secrets now include `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` and `GEMINI_API_KEY`; only secret names were verified.
- GitHub `production` environment secrets now also include `DATABASE_URL` and `AETHER_CART_TOKEN_SECRET`; only secret names were verified.
- GitHub `production` environment variables now include `GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-3.5-flash` and `AI_EVAL_MAX_CASES=10`.
- GitHub `production` environment variables now include `NEXT_PUBLIC_AETHER_AI_URL=https://aether-ai.pickofwow.workers.dev`.
- Direct Gemini model lookup against the official Gemini API passed for `models/gemini-3.5-flash` with supported generation methods `generateContent`, `countTokens`, `createCachedContent` and `batchGenerateContent`.
- The Cloudflare free-tier deployment now uses a lightweight TypeScript Worker with Gemini REST, avoiding unsupported Python Worker native dependencies such as `grpcio`, `msgpack` and `pydantic-core`.
- `.github/workflows/ai-assistant-image.yml` exists to build, smoke and publish the assistant Docker image to GitHub Container Registry.
- Runtime storage schema indexes are now aligned with `migrations/0001_initial.sql` and covered by `tests/test_migrations.py` plus `python tests/run_direct.py`.
- Assistant product-card add-to-cart now sends only slug, variant and quantity to the cart API and syncs local cart state from the server-validated cart response.
- Assistant streaming UI now renders product cards, cart summaries and clarification prompts from structured SSE events before the final `assistant.completed` payload.
- Streaming cart updates now render a cart summary with an explicit open-cart action as soon as `assistant.cart_updated` arrives.
- Malformed streaming cart summaries are ignored by the widget instead of being rendered as trusted cart state.
- Cloudflare Worker deployment files now exist for the free-tier assistant target: `worker.ts`, `wrangler.jsonc`, and `.github/workflows/deploy-ai-assistant-cloudflare.yml`.

## Fixes Applied On 2026-07-21

- The assistant widget now detects category context on both standalone storefront routes and merged deployment routes:
  - `/categories/:slug`
  - `/store/categories/:slug`
- Added an E2E test proving category context is sent to the assistant.
- Updated dynamic Next.js route pages to await `params`, avoiding runtime/build issues with current Next.js dynamic APIs.
- Added an automated graph-structure test proving the required LangGraph control nodes are present.
- Added an automated documentation and CI acceptance test so required assistant docs, diagrams, README operations, minimum pipeline gates, and required environment variables remain covered.
- Added visible add-to-cart feedback in the assistant widget product cards and covered it with E2E.
- Made the assistant widget full-screen on mobile while keeping the compact desktop panel, and covered the mobile layout/focus behavior with E2E.
- Added Escape-key close behavior and focus return to the assistant trigger, covered by desktop and mobile E2E.
- Added safe handling for malformed assistant SSE payloads so invalid JSON produces a generic user-facing error without exposing internal strings.
- Rendered product-card availability and color/size variant data from structured assistant fields, and disabled add-to-cart for unavailable products.
- Added the `ProductVariant` OpenAPI schema and strengthened API contract tests for product-card variant, availability, image, color, size, and rating fields.
- Added a production deployment workflow gate that runs the assistant container smoke test after image build and before Cloudflare deployment steps.
- Added cleanup traps to the AI assistant Docker smoke-test steps in root CI, nested Aether CI, and production deployment workflows.
- Hardened `clear_cart` so the graph must provide an internal confirmation token after the user writes the explicit confirmation phrase; direct tool calls without that token fail and are covered by tests.
- Hardened public cart reads so `GET /api/v1/cart/:id` requires the same signed `x-aether-cart-token` used by cart mutations; storefront cart display, the shared API client and AI assistant cart reads now send that token, and contracts/OpenAPI/docs were updated.
- Hardened the evaluation PII metric so card-redaction cases validate the actual redacted input instead of only trusting the expected fixture flag.
- Added an early production workflow guard for `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, and documented the required GitHub Actions variables/secrets.
- Added `npm run deploy:preflight` to verify required GitHub Actions variables and secrets before manually running the production workflow.
- Updated `npm run deploy:preflight` to accept secrets and variables from the GitHub `production` environment, matching the deployment workflow.
- Extended `npm run deploy:preflight` to warn when AI assistant production/evaluation settings are incomplete, including `NEXT_PUBLIC_AETHER_AI_URL`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_MODEL` and `AI_EVAL_MAX_CASES`.
- Added production readiness checks so `/readyz` reports `not_ready` when `AI_DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT=production` and server-side Gemini/PostgreSQL/Redis/cart-token/CORS configuration is incomplete.
- Added a local acceptance audit script so artifact completeness and production blockers are visible before marking the implementation complete.
- Added `scripts/acceptance_audit.py` to CI and production deployment validation before Docker/deploy steps.
- Added `requirements-audit.md` so each major original requirement is tied to direct evidence or a named production blocker.
- Hardened real Gemini evaluation with Windows SelectorEventLoop support, per-case timeouts and safe aggregated failure reasons.
- Added the `AI assistant image` workflow so a validated assistant container can be published to GHCR with both `latest` and commit-SHA tags.
- Aligned the runtime storage schema with the migration indexes for conversation lookup, user deletion, audit lookup and usage reporting.
- Hardened the assistant widget add-to-cart flow so it no longer constructs a local product with assistant-provided prices; E2E now asserts the backend receives the product slug and variant.
- Added E2E coverage proving `assistant.products` streaming events render structured product cards without waiting for the final completed response.
- Added E2E coverage proving `assistant.cart_updated` streaming events render subtotal/item count and expose the cart navigation action.
- Added E2E coverage proving malformed `assistant.cart_updated` payloads do not render cart totals or cart navigation actions.
- Added a Cloudflare Worker deployment path using Wrangler and `worker.ts`; Docker dependencies remain in `requirements-docker.txt` for local/container validation of the full Python assistant.

## Pending Evidence Before Marking Complete

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_AETHER_AI_URL` is configured, but `https://aether-ai.pickofwow.workers.dev` has not yet been proven reachable by a completed Cloudflare deploy.
- GHCR image publication has not been proven by a completed GitHub Actions run yet.
- Limited Gemini classifier evaluation should be rerun from the deployed runtime.
- Staging deployment of the AI assistant service has not been proven from this workspace.
- Production deployment of the AI assistant service has not been proven from this workspace.
- Re-run the requirement-by-requirement audit after environment-backed evidence exists.

## Current Deployment Note

The existing public Aether storefront and Worker API are deployed and responding, but the AI assistant changes in this workspace are local unless committed, pushed, and deployed through the configured pipeline.
